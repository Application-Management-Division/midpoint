== Description

The MidPoint *REST API* is one of the interfaces which gives you the possibility to
access and interact with the data present in your midPoint instance.

The REST api gives you a feature rich toolset with which you can operate over different
*web resources*, these are represented as specific endpoints to which you send your operation request.

There are many possibilities which we provide in regard to the web resources you can access. So many
that we have a dedicated page for them.

.To display a *list of the types of resources* please have a look at:
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/resource-types/[Web Resource Types]

.For a *more technical description* of our REST api please have a look here:
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/[Concepts]

== How To Use

The *format of the REST request* depends on the type of web resource you try to invoke, the  operation
which you want to execute and any additional options you wish to specify for the request.

The most *basic form* of the url request would be:

// TODO add full complexity or keep this simple example ???

// [source, http]
// ----
// http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{web_resource_type}/{operation}
// ----

// [source, http]
// ----
// xref::/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/operations/examples/get-user-self/#_ex_get_own_profile_information[]
// ----
.Request to read own profile data (raw)
[source,http]
----
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self?raw=true
----
.Request to read own profile data (raw) full example using CURL
xref::/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/operations/examples/get-user-self/#_ex_get_own_profile_information_json_raw[Request to
read own profile data]

Naturally by having a feature rich interface there is no "one size fits them all" way to invoke the operations, so the url will
be different in specific use cases. The most common ones you can see
at xref:/#_common_use_cases[this] section of the documentation.

The REST interface provides you with a long list of *web resource types* which you can access. The interface also provides
you with *different kinds of operations*, based on the type of resource you choose.

.The *full collection of web resource types* can be found here:
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/resource-types/[Web Resource Types]

== MidPoint Client

To ease up the development of you own implementation of a MidPoint REST client. Please
have a look and consider using the midPoint Java Client project:
