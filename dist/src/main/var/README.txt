This is the default "midPoint home" directory.

This can be changed by setting MIDPOINT_HOME environment variable
before using script in the bin directory.
This can also be set in bin/setenv.sh (or BAT), the file needs to be created,
along with any other variables.

Place any additional libs/JARs (like JDBC drivers) into $MIDPOINT_HOME/lib.
DO NOT place them into lib in the midPoint distribution root (next to midpoint.war).

If you use custom MIDPOINT_HOME, this directory can be ignored or even removed.
You'll miss this README though.
