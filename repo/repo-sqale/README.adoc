= midScale new SQL repository experiments

As a non-involved developer you may ignore this directory.
It is not part of the current midPoint build.

See also https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/midscale/design/repository-design/[midScale Repository Design] document.

== Notes

* Directory `sql` contains various init scripts and experiments.
Some of these will be moved to `config/sql` when proven worthy.
* Create DB schema script (WIP): link:sql/pgnew-repo.sql[]
* Useful inserts, selects, etc.: link:sql/pgnew-experiments.sql[]

== Extension attributes (JSONB?)

[NOTE]
The whole section deals with *indexed extension* attributes only.
If the attribute is not used for search, it does not have to be extracted from `fullobject` representation.
It's likely the word "indexed" (or even "extension") will be omitted a lot in this section but is implied.

It is very tempting to replace the current master-detail (or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model[EAV])
model for indexed extension attributes with something that does not require JOIN or EXISTS.
Also, we need various extension tables for various data types.
Can https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-json.html[JSON types] (namely JSONB) be our salvation?
We need to strike the balance between *query performance* and *extension attributes maintainability/flexibility*.

Regarding *query performance* we have to realize that even current implementation under favorable
conditions (middle-sized databases) has various levels of performance for various operations:

* Equality, comparison and "starts with" filters can rely on indexes like `iAExtensionDate` for `m_assignment_ext_date (dateValue)`.
// TODO: why is this on dateValue only and not combined with item_id?

* "Ends with" or "contains" substrings are not optimized unless we add a trigram or similar index,
see https://stackoverflow.com/a/17646278/658826[this answer]
and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/indexes-types.html[index types documentation].
Trigram indexes support only alphanumerical characters and can, reportedly, be huge and inefficient.
"Ends with" can benefit from `reverse()` index.

* Case-insensitive search is not optimized without appropriate function-based index.


=== Modeling options

Following options are available, but they still must be proved:

* Single JSONB for all attributes stored in an object, some of them possibly multi-valued
with values stored in an array.
There are two sub-options here (actual key values like `hobbies` can actually be synthetic identifiers,
e.g. referencing PK from the global catalogue of extension attributes):
** Using `{"hobbies": "video", ...}` style (the value can also be an array).
The conditions then may look like `ext->'hobbies' @> '"video"'` where `ext` is JSONB extension column.
** More normalized `[{"key": "hobbies", "value": "video"}, ...]` with condition to `key` AND `value`.
It feels noisy and indirect if we use JSONB in the first place, requires more conditions for the same
thing and creates bigger JSON.

+
--
The nice thing about single JSONB column is it requires no DDL management during runtime.
If this is usable it also eliminates the question of how to store different sets of extensions
on different sets of the same type (e.g. shadows for different resources).

One possible problem is that the whole JSONB value must be updated so the column value can be
a source of contention if small changes (e.g. value of a single attribute) are performed
on large extensions containing a lot of data.

Also, related to the "blobby" nature of all-in-one JSON, it can be more costly for more difficult
queries like substrings where index helps only partially and the value must be consulted.
As the JSON grows it can be more and more expensive to filter over it (probably more if TOAST-ed).
--

* Each attribute in separate columns of various non-JSON types with multi-values stored as JSON array.
This makes each column simpler but requires dynamic DDL management and other complications mentioned
above that single general JSONB does not have.

* Master-detail (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model[EAV])
model is still in play as well if nothing above works well enough.
Following modifications are possible:

** Splitting tables for single-value and multi-value attributes.
** Separate tables for attributes used most (e.g. some external identifier used for all users),
especially if multi-valued.

* Single JSON column for single-value attributes but keeping multi-value attributes in separate
table(s) (per type or per attribute).
This is a mix of the first approach ("JSONB handles it all") and some version EAV model just mentioned.

The typical problems are:

* How to identify attributes?
Attributes are identified with synthetic identifier from extension attributes catalog.
Legacy implementation uses `m_ext_item` table and its `id` column - this works just fine.
Repository can easily cache this catalog, there is no need to JOIN the table.

* Check if some multi-value attribute contains a value.
With `ext->'hobby' @> '"video"'` (`ext` being of type JSONB) it's possible to check value exactly.
There may be problem with ignore-case and starts/endsWith operations.

* Various operations can be used against simple attributes when the value is extracted, e.g.
`ext->>'personalEmail' LIKE...

* Extracting value from an array is a bit https://stackoverflow.com/a/49542329/658826[more tricky]):
+
[source,sql]
----
select some objects ...
where exists (select from jsonb_array_elements_text(ext->'hobbies') v
    where jsonb_typeof(ext->'hobbies') = 'array'
    and upper(v::text) LIKE '%ING')
----
+
It is crucial to either be sure `hobbies` is always array (this should be preferable solution)
or add the `jsonb_typeof` check.
This also mentions how important can be when LIMIT is used.
*From personal experience during all these experiments, using LIMIT on queries without aggregate functions
was always much faster, even when no index was used at all.*
It is also possible to join scalar and arrays, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/39237349/658826[this answer]
for more - but that requires union.
I suggest we always know whether concrete extension attribute is array or scalar and *keep it consistent*.

=== Other technical problems

* https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/[This post] points to various indexing/planning
problems, i.e. planner guessing many more rows to be returned.
Also, JIT slowing down execution of queries was mentioned.

* Pure GIN index can get big depending on the number of different values used.
It's tricky to use as only some operators are supported - contains/equals are possible, but not comparison or LIKE.
It can still help with other operations by selecting only relevant rows containing the attribute (with any value)
and then adding the condition of interest, e.g.: `

TODO SEE: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49826693/658826
TODO also: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12612255 see arrays, composite types, hstore options

=== Extension attribute types in JSONB

* String, booleans and numbers (whole or floating points) as native JSON types.

* Dates as ISO formatted strings - do we need dates or just date+times?
What about local vs timezones?
We probably want to enforce timezones, but is it possible that some dates will have "local date" semantics.

* Polystring TODO as `{"orig": ..., "norm": ...}`?

* References TODO

What are the typical operations on various types?

* Comparing (lt/gt) numbers, dates and even strings (but first two are crucial).
* LIKE and ignore case comparison.
* Ordering? Do we use it now? Do we need it?

Is policy situation related or not?

=== GIN indexes

Using https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/gin-intro.html[GIN indexes] is tricky.
Where clauses have to follow certain forms to benefit from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING[JSONB indexing].
For example:

[source,sql]
----
-- with this index
CREATE INDEX m_user_ext_idx ON m_user USING gin (ext);

-- the following where does not use it
select * from m_user
    where ext->>'email' = 'user11666123@mycompany.com';

-- but this one does (found entry can have other attributes just fine)
select * from m_user
    where ext @> '{"email": "user11666123@mycompany.com"}'
----

Alternatively, more specific GIN indexes can be added, but I'd not recommend this by default.
If some high-business-value custom query takes longer it may benefit from the manually added index,
typically function based with some JSON selector inside.
It is however not recommended as a preventive measure, because this would require many indexes.
Also, joining multiple indexes during an execution can take longer than using single (seemingly less efficient) index,
see https://medium.com/plangrid-technology/indexing-with-postgres-when-less-is-more-7337d6f09048[this story].
Finally, each index incurs a penalty for updates and inserts and takes additional space.

Just for example, the following indexes could be created for each attribute (doesn't mean they should):

* `((ext->>'attr'))` for conditions on `ext->>'attr'` of any kind, but mostly comparison.
* TODO... lower (or upper)
* TODO min/max functional for arrays (https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/202761/157622[this answer]).
* trigram index for "endsWith"?

All these indexes could be made much smaller by adding `WHERE ext ? 'attr'`.
The condition then must be used in the query too, which should not be a problem.
I recommend to use `ext?'attr'` in the query in any case because even without these indexes it can
benefit from the generic GIN index a lot.

== TODO

* Can we merge boring entities to a single `m_object_generic` table?
Things like `m_sequence`, `m_security_policy`, `m_system_configuration`, etc.
Of course, if some of these can have many rows it's not desirable, perhaps it's more confusing in general anyway.
* How is `m_object_subtype` (`ObjectType.subtype`) used and searched?
*Obsolete,* even if necessary, single JSON array should cover it, no entity needed.
* Untackled yet: Tree tables, organization, see: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ltree.html
* Mention how LIMIT makes queries faster, mentioned in comments to https://stackoverflow.com/a/49542329/658826[this answer].
This "top-N queries" are also favored in "SQL Performance Explained" book.
Also, that Q/A shows how to look into JSON array with `jsonb_array_elements` without expanding the result with the help of `EXISTS`.
* For comparison of values stored in an array (multi-value extensions) see https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/202761/157622[this answer].
It demonstrates interesting functional index for max value that can be used for `>` operation
(if the array has higher max than the searched value, it has at least some higher value and the whole row matches).
While interesting, we have to be careful not to pollute the DB with many small indexes.

== PostgreSQL table inheritance

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-inherit.html[Table inheritance] is a nice mechanism
that allows creating table hierarchies, so we see all objects in one table and various subtypes in
inherited tables.
*It is also an implicit method for partitioning*, at least from the perspective of the parent table(s).

* We need "abstract" tables like `m_object`.
Alternative would be a view with `SELECT ... UNION` and common columns have to be repeated in DDL.
Ideally we don't want to insert into abstract tables, we can use `check (false) no inherit` for this.
"Check false" always fails, but this is not inherited by sub-tables.
Updates of common columns or deletes on abstract tables still work with expected results
(not possible with view without additional measures like triggers).

* PKs, FKs and most of other constraints must be declared on each sub-table.
Only check and not-null constraints are inherited, unless `no inherit` is declared.
See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-inherit.html#DDL-INHERIT-CAVEATS[inheritance caveats].

* To assure globally unique PKs we have to use triggers on sub-tables or separate OID-pool table.
We chose the separate table solution after
See http://blog.ioguix.net/postgresql/2015/02/05/Partitionning-and-constraints-part-1.html[this post]
for more - especially the solution towards the end with advisory locks.
The part with the support for other types is also handy, because UUID is bigger than bigint for lock.

* UUID is far from the first recommendation for a PK, but it's impractical to use anything else for midPoint.
Even with additional serial PK the objects are searched by their OID, so it would have to be indexed
and its uniqueness assured and then it can just be PK directly.
Smaller PK could be beneficial only as FK from other tables, e.g. instead of `targetRef_oid` for associations.
This could still mean that we need to follow the FK to resolve it to OID which we use in application.

* We want to generate OID in the database, so `DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` is used for `OID`
column directly in the master table `m_object`.

* To assure unique OIDs we will use separate `m_object_oid` table.
Triggers for insert and delete will assure the consistency between this and `m_object` hierarchy.
For inserts we have to generate OID if its not provided or use the one that is - in both cases
the new OID is inserted into `m_object_oid`.
Updates of OID are forbidden which is also guarded by a trigger, otherwise it would be able to
change OID to already existing OID from another table (PK does not allow it for the same table).

* Can we partition inherited table? Like `m_shadow`.
*No, this is not possible.*
Options:
** Using "application managed partitioning" with inheritance as needed.
We prefer this, it is more cumbersome, but possibly more flexible.
It also allows adding different extensions for different tables, e.g. based on resource.
** Shadow would not be part of `m_object` hierarchy.

* Foreign key can't be used against `m_object.oid` because it does not enforce index (by itself).
Perhaps we want to introduce `m_object_oid` table that would own the unique pool of OIDs and could
be used for referencing FKs.
Referencing only some types of objects (e.g. just focuses) is probably mission impossible.


* TODO: membership searches on abstract tables (e.g. focus), EXPLAIN, performance?

* TODO: logging of all statements for experiments?
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/722221/how-to-log-postgresql-queries

* TODO: tablespaces?

* The default `public` schema is used for all midpoint objects, that's OK.

== Maintenance

We may need regular `ANALYZE` and/or `VACUUM`.
This should be run regularly - can it be done in DB or should MP call this or something else will trigger it?

== Performance drop with volume

TL/DR:

* After first million, insert performance drops.
* So does query, but if it uses an index, not that significantly.
* Count queries suffer with volume - avoid count whenever possible.
* Avoid solutions where number of inherited tables affects the performance, e.g. unique over
hierarchy - perhaps externalize it to dedicated table.
* Nothing was optimized, it was just couple of experiments to get a feeling for it.
* After mass-deletes, performance can still be slow before `VACUUM` and/or `ANALYZE` is not ran.

Tested on VirtualBox, 2 GB RAM, 60+ GB disk.

Insert performance measurements:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO m_user (nameNorm, nameOrig, version)
  VALUES ('user-' || LPAD(r::text, 10, '0'), 'user-' || LPAD(r::text, 10, '0'), 1);
----

Both name columns are indexed, `nameNorm` is also unique.
Loop is used to INSERT the rows, which is slower than `INSERT from SELECT` with `generate_series`,
but closer to real scenario that uses separate statements (although there are no round-trips here).

Effect of the number of inherited tables on INSERT performance.
`VACUUM` was used after massive deletes, otherwise the times for 10M were similar to 40M.
This should not be problematic when separate `m_object_oid` table is used now.

|===
| Inherited{nbsp}tables / Existing rows | 4 | 50 | 100

| 0 | 6s | 6s | 6s
| 1M | 6s | - | 6s
| 10M | 29/14/14s | - | 28/12/27s
| 40M | 74/70/72s | 70s | 70s
|===

Conclusion - as there is no check against `m_object` there is no negative impact of the hierarchy on the performance.

Table sizes after x inserts (index means PK index):

|===
| Inserted rows total | User table/index size | OID table/index size | DB size

| 0 | | |
| 1M | 96/30 MB | 42/30 MB | 266 MB
| 10M | 965/446 MB | 422/446 MB | 2888 MB
| 40M | 3858/1721 MB | 1689/1721 MB | 11 GB
|===

With user's names formatted like `user-0000000001` both name indexes had 1269 MB at 40M rows.

== Performance of searching for unused OIDs

If delete is not guarded by a trigger, `m_object_oid` can have unused OIDs.
It's crucial to use the right select/delete construction to find/delete them.
With 26M rows naive approach with `NOT IN` to delete 200k unused OIDs took over 1h without finishing.
Following output shows the plan for `NOT IN`, `LEFT JOIN` and `NOT EXISTS`.
Latter two use `Parallel Hash Anti Join` which is good, `NOT IN` uses `Parallel Seq Scan` which is not.
`NOT EXISTS` is practical for `DELETE`/`UPDATE` and perfectly valid to use.
The previous problem (deleting 200k unused OIDs from 26M total) was solved in around 150s.
