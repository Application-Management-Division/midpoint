/**
 *  A task that is directly used to execute the handler code.
 *
 *  It is a very sensitive structure. First of all, it must be thread-safe because it is used for the handler code execution
 *  and at the same time accessed by clients that need to check its state. There are two such situations:
 *  (1) Lightweight Asynchronous Tasks because they have no persistent representation. The only instance that exists
 *      is the one that is being executed by a handler.
 *  (2) When a client asks the task manager for a current state of the task (typically being interested in operational stats).
 *      The information could be fetched from the repository but it would be a bit outdated. This situation can be avoided
 *      by retrieving information always from the repository, sacrificing information timeliness a bit. But the (1) cannot.
 *
 *  Some information related to task execution (e.g. list of lightweight asynchronous tasks, information on task thread, etc)
 *  is relevant only for running tasks. Therefore they are moved here.
