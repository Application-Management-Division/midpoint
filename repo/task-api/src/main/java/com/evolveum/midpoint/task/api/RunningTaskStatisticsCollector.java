/**
 * "Statistics collection" aspect of a running task.
 *
 * Definition: Statistics are:
 *
 * 1. Operational statistics (OperationStatsType),
 * 2. Structured progress,
 * 3. Legacy progress.
 *
 * Various parts of operational statistics (e.g. synchronization information, actions executed information) are optional:
 * they may or may not be maintained.
 *
 * Also, structured progress may or may not be maintained. For example, it is intentionally not maintained in LATs.
 * If it is maintained, the legacy progress is computed from it.
 *
 * BEWARE: Thread-local statistics (repo, caching, ...) need to be updated ONLY from the thread to which they are related.
 * This is controlled by `updateThreadLocalStatistics` parameter. Be sure to set it to `true` only when running in appropriate
 * thread. (There is a check for that, but we should not rely on it too much.)
 *
 * The process of updating statistics is multi-level:
 *
 * 1. From thread-local structures to task.statistics field. (This is the thread-critical part.) This has to be done for
 * low-level statistics that are gathered for current thread: repo, cache, etc. See {@link #refreshThreadLocalStatistics()}.
 *
 * 2. From task.statistics to task.prism. Here the subtask aggregation usually takes place. Can be done from any thread.
 * See {@link #updateStatisticsInTaskPrism(boolean)}.
 *
 * 3. From task.prism to the repository. This takes a lot of time, so it is driven by time interval.
 * See {@link #updateAndStoreStatisticsIntoRepository(boolean, OperationResult)} and {@link #storeStatisticsIntoRepositoryIfTimePassed(Runnable, OperationResult)}
 * methods.
 *
 * Statistics collection is always started by calling {@link #startCollectingStatistics(StatisticsCollectionStrategy)} method.
